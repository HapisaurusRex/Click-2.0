Documenting the intergration of smartness/automation into my robot computer xy plotter

The general idea: Get something to recognize what's on the screen, what is the screen, and how that thing can move a mouse to click stuff on said screen.


Current stage: make a python program that can do that first before attempting to integrate with my robot x-y plotter
Test environment: Cookie Clicker (has objects that can be identified, can still be used to integrate with robot x-y plotter, not too action intensive and fun to watch while coding the program)

The robot has a webcam and can run image detection, so we need to create a program that can do things without parsing webpages. The program has to:
- figure out where the screen is
- identify numbers by the way they look
- be able to control the x-y plotter and click on any upgrades
